    <h1>Hi, I'm vikas singh Secretary of the Robotics Club</h1>
    <p>Welcome! I’m here to share our exciting summer robotics projects with you. </p>

    <h2>Our Summer Projects</h2>

        <h3>Ball-Balancing Bot</h3>
        <p>A Ball Balancing Bot is a robotic platform designed to maintain a ball's position at the center of a flat surface. Utilizing actuators (like servos or linear actuators) and sensors (such as cameras or infrared sensors), the system dynamically adjusts the platform's orientation to counteract the ball's movements, demonstrating principles of control systems and real-time feedback.

        <h3>Space Station Simulator</h3>
        <p>You have a robot on a grid. It must move from S (start) to G (goal) without hitting (walls) and while avoiding  (mud) and  (hills), which slow it down. The goal is to find the least costly path, not just the shortest one.

        <h3>Hexapod</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on implementing inverse kinematics for a 3-DOF hexapod leg, aiming to calculate the necessary joint angles—coxa (α), femur (β), and tibia (γ)—to position the foot at a specified 3D coordinate. The solution includes coordinate transformations, handles unreachable positions gracefully, and undergoes testing across various target positions to ensure accuracy and robustness.

        <h3>Mechanical turk</h3>
        <p>The CNC system is a precise robotic mechanism that moves the arm across the chessboard in X, Y, and Z directions. It uses stepper motors, linear guides, and a rigid frame to accurately position the gripper for picking and placing chess pieces. Controlled by a microcontroller with motor drivers, it converts computer commands into smooth, repeatable movements over the board.</p>

        <h3>StepXplorer</h3>
        <p>A stair-climbing robot with a hybrid mechanism, real-time sensor feedback, and Arduino-based control for servo selection and motion. Designed to adapt, detect faults, and maintain balance while navigating uneven terrains.
