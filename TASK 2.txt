I find the Mechanical Turk project very interesting because it has include  many cool ideas like understanding of machines  and  most importantly chess that i love to play. I like how the project involves building a system that can sense where the chess pieces  are  and then how a robot uses his  arm to move them . It’s kinda  exciting to think about making that a machine  can actually play chess by using his mind and hand . I’m also curious about how the robot will understand human moves and then respond with its own.i am just curious about these things .
